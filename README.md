# What it does 

It allows you to select an array size (animation speed will increase relatively to that) then select an algorithm type to sort the array with. 
When you can on the algorithm button it will trigger the sorting. 
To re-initialize, click on the "logo" on the header's left. 

Kind of responsive but not totally yet on the array visualizer section
